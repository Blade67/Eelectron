# Eelectron
###### Electron meets EJS

Eelectron is aimed to be simple to use for small and light weight Electron apps using EJS.
It uses in addition to EJS:
 - Babel - for ES6 language support
 - SASS-Pack - for compiling SASS/SCSS
 - Nodemon - for auto restart/recompile

This project is by no means meant to be complex, on the contrary, it is meant to be as easely usable as possible, without confusing people with Webpack, Gulp or Grunt files.


## How to use:

Nothing more simple. From your command line:
```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Blade67/Eelectron
# Go into the repository
cd Eelectron
# Install dependencies and run the app
npm install && npm start
```
